// In MongoDB, the aggregation pipeline is a framework for performing data transformations and analysis on the documents in a collection. It allows you to process data through a sequence of stages, where each stage performs a specific operation on the input data and passes the result to the next stage.



*) Syntax

use your_database

db.your_collection.aggregate([
    // Stage 1: Match documents based on a condition
    { $match: { /* Your match condition */ } },

    // Stage 2: Group documents based on certain criteria
    { $group: { /* Your grouping criteria */ } },

    // Stage 3: Project fields to include/exclude in the output
    { $project: { /* Your projection specifications */ } },

    // Additional stages as needed
    // { $unwind: /* ... */ },
    // { $sort: /* ... */ },
    // { $limit: /* ... */ },
    // { $skip: /* ... */ },
])
