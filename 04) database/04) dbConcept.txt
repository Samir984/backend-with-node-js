**) KEY => Keys are the attribute which help us to uniqulty identify each tuples in table;

There are 4 type of key.They are:

1). Super Key: =>A super key is a set of one or more columns (attributes) that, taken together, can uniquely identify each row in a table.

*) A super key may contain more columns than necessary to uniquely identify a row. It could include additional columns that are not required for uniqueness.

*) Every candidate key is a super key, but not every super key is a candidate key.
-----------------------------------------


2).Candidate Key: => A candidate key is a minimal super key, meaning it is a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table, and no subset of those columns can uniquely identify a row.

*) In simpler terms, a candidate key is a super key with the fewest possible columns.

*) A table may have multiple candidate keys.
The primary key is selected from the candidate keys to be the main unique identifier for a table.
-------------------------------------------


3).Primary Key: => The primary key is a candidate key that is chosen as the main unique identifier for a table which shouldn't be null.

*) It is used to enforce entity integrity, meaning that each row in the table is uniquely identified by its primary key.

*) By default, the primary key also implies a unique constraint and a NOT NULL constraint on the specified columns.
-----------------------------------------------


4).Alternate Key: => An alternate key is any candidate key that is not selected as the primary key.

*) While the primary key is the main unique identifier, alternate keys are still unique and can be used to identify rows uniquely

-------------------------------------------------

5) Composite key: => A key that consists of two or more attributes that together uniquely idenity the record(row) in a table.

----------------------------------------------------

6) Foreign key: => A foreign key is a column in a database table that links to the primary key in another table, enforcing referential integrity.
*) It ensures that values in the foreign key column correspond to existing values in the referenced table. 

*) Foreign keys establish relationships between tables.
